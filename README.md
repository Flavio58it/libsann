# libsann - Neural networks library 

## What's inside

**libsann**

libsann is a little [artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) framework written in C++.

Provide the following configurations:

- M-Adeline
- Feed Forward
- Kohonen Map
- Elman Feed Forward

And the following learning algorithms:

- Windrow Hoff
- Auto organizing
- Back propagation
- Resilient propagation

**libsannNET**

Basic wrapper to use libsann in .Net

> The Wrapper is only for the feed forward configuration (the most usesd in the applications)

**libsannNETWorkbenchToolkit**

Workbench application to test patterns set and performance of the network configurations.
You can choose a configuration, load patterns, set the learning method and see the network results and learning time in a graph.
